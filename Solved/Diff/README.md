> Sometimes, the differences matter. Especially between the files in [this archive](13ba256ab906972b29db61df6d68e77627aeea241105816fef61f06e1d19b747_file.tar).

> Hint: This is a TAR archive file. You can extract the files inside this tar by navigating to the directory where you downloaded it and running `tar xf file.tar`! If you don't have tar on your personal computer, you could try doing it from the Shell server. Once you extract the files, try comparing the hex encodings of the files against the first file.

## Hint
