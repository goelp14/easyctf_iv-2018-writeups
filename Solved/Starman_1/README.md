# Starman 1
Programming - 80 points

## Challenge 
> Written by blockingthesky

> Starman has taken off in search of a team to help him win EasyCTF! He's reached the asteroid belt, which everyone knows is the best place in the galaxy to find cybersecurity talent. Each asteroid is home to one superstar hacker. Starman wants to take all of the hackers back to Earth to help him with the competition, but unfortunately this isn't practical - all of the hackers are very attached to their asteroid homes, and won't go back to Earth unless Starman agrees to take the asteroids with him. Furthermore, each hacker has a skill rating `r`. To ensure a win in EasyCTF, Starman wants to maximize the sum of the rating values of his team members.

> There are `N` hackers, and Starman's Roadster can carry up to `W` pounds of additional weight. Help him decide which hackers to bring home.

> #### Input Format
The first line contains two integers `N` and `W`. The following `N` lines each contain two integers `r_i` and `w_i`, representing the skill and weight of the `ith` hacker. (`w_i` is the sum of a hacker and their asteroid's weight).

> `1 <= N, W <= 2000`

> `1 <= r_i, w_i <= 10000`

> #### Output Format
A single integer, the best sum-of-ratings Starman can achieve while keeping the total weight added to his Roadster less than or equal to `W`.

> #### Sample Input
	5 15
	6 7
	3 4
	3 5
	10 11
	8 8

> #### Sample Ouput
	14

## Hint
> If you run into issues with the time limit, try reading up on Dynamic Programming.

## Solution

Doing bruteforce by using itertools combinations, it runs into time-limit issues and also takes up a lot of RAM

> python3 bruteforce.py

Solving requires Dynamic Programming, specifically the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

Thankfully, there's [some code available which I adapted to fit this problem](https://github.com/kaushikthedeveloper/GeeksforGeeks-python/blob/master/Scripts/)
