> Given two integers `a` and `b`, return `a` xor `b`. Remember, the xor operator is a bitwise operator that's usually represented by the `^` character.

> For example, if your input was `5 7`, then you should print `2`.

## Solution
Easy in python3

	text = input().split(' ')
	a = int(text[0])
	b = int(text[1])
	print(a^b)
